## Measurement Explanations

### Water Metrics

- **pH Level**: Measures how acidic or basic water is. The ideal range is 6.5-8.5, with 7 being neutral.
- **Turbidity (NTU)**: Measures water cloudiness. Lower values indicate clearer water. PCMC standards require <5 NTU.
- **Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)**: Measures inorganic salts and small organic matter dissolved in water. Ideal range is 300-500 mg/L.
- **MLD**: Million Liters per Day - Standard unit for measuring water volume in municipal supply systems.

### Energy Metrics

- **MW**: Megawatt - Unit of power equal to one million watts, used to measure electricity generation capacity.
- **MWh**: Megawatt Hour - Unit of energy equivalent to one megawatt of power sustained for one hour.
- **kWh**: Kilowatt Hour - Standard unit for measuring electricity consumption in homes.
- **T&D Losses**: Transmission and Distribution Losses - Percentage of electricity lost during transmission from generation to consumption.
- **Peak Demand**: Highest amount of electricity drawn from the grid at any given time, measured in MW.
- **Voltage**: Standard household voltage in India is 230V Â± 10%. Deviations can damage appliances.
- **Frequency**: Standard grid frequency in India is 50 Hz. Variations indicate grid instability.
